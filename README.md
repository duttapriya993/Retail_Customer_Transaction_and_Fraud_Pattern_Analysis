# 🛍️ Retail Customer Transaction Analysis with Fraud Detection

### 🔍 Business Case:
A fintech/retail company wants to analyze customer transactions to:
- Identify high-value customers 💰  
- Detect suspicious patterns 🚨  
- Provide business teams a dashboard for actionable insights 📊

---

### 🛠️ Tools Used:
- **SQL** – Data cleaning, joins, fraud flag analysis  
- **Power BI** – KPI dashboards, top performers, fraud analytics  
- **Python (Pandas, Seaborn)** – Fraud patterns, customer & regional insights  

---

### 📂 Project Components:
| Component | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `transactions.csv` | Raw transaction data |
| `customers.csv` | Customer demographic & signup info |
| `merchants.csv` | Merchant details including city, category |
| `Customer_Transaction_Merged_Cleaned.csv` | Final merged dataset (used in Python) |
| `Retail_Insights_SQL_Priya_Dutta.sql` | SQL queries + insights |
| `Retail_Insights_PowerBI_Priya_Dutta.pdf` | Final Power BI Dashboard (3 Pages) |
| `Retail_Fraud_Transaction_Analysis_Priya_Dutta.ipynb` | Python notebook with fraud analysis |
| `Retail_Fraud_Transaction_Analysis_Priya_Dutta.pdf` | Exported PDF version of Python analysis |
| `README.md` | Project overview & documentation |

---

### 💡 Key Features:
- Total Revenue, Orders, and Avg Transaction KPIs  
- Fraud detection by region, payment method, city, category  
- Top 5 customers & merchants  
- Monthly sales trend 📈  
- Regional heatmaps 🔥 (Python)  
- Interactive filters for deeper insights  

---

### 🧠 SQL Analysis Summary:
- Cleaned & joined 3 datasets  
- Performed fraud count, fraud % by region, merchant type, etc.  
- Used `CASE`, `GROUP BY`, `JOIN`, and aggregation functions  
- Derived insights like top regions, categories, fraud-prone areas  

---

### 📊 Power BI Dashboard Pages:
1. **Business Overview** – Revenue, avg transaction, category insights  
2. **Top Performers** – Top customers, merchants, monthly trend  
3. **Fraud Analytics** – Region-wise fraud %, payment-type breakdown, city fraud map  

---

### 🐍 Python Insights:
- Used pandas to load & clean merged dataset  
- Performed fraud analysis by Region
- Top 5 cities by Revenue  
- Visualized fraud % by Region (Seaborn)  
- Heatmap: Fraudulent transactions by Region & Category 🔥

### 💼 Resume Description (2–3 lines):
> **Retail Customer Transaction Analysis** using SQL, Python, and Power BI. Built an end-to-end project to detect fraud patterns, analyze top customers/merchants, and visualize insights through a dynamic dashboard.

---

### 🗣️ Interview Elevator Pitch:
> “This project simulates a real-world fintech scenario. I started with SQL to clean and analyze 7500 customer transactions. Then, I used Power BI to create a professional dashboard for decision-makers. Finally, I added a Python notebook for fraud detection and visual analysis using Seaborn. The project reflects how I can combine data engineering, analytics, and visualization tools to solve real business problems.”

---

### 📌 Why This Project Stands Out:
- ✅ End-to-end ownership of analysis → dashboard → insights  
- ✅ Realistic business goals: customer value + fraud risk  
- ✅ Great for GitHub, LinkedIn, and interview presentation
